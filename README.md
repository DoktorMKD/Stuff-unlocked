# Stuff++ Unlocked

After Zordacz received a perma ban Stuff++ randomly stopped working shortly after. It was then, when I reverse engineered the script and made it working again under the name **Staff++ Unlocked**. Then again it stopped working, because Zordacz made some **checks on purpose** for the script to stop working when some hardcoded day is reached.

After that I didn't want to dig more, so I used Stuff modified by another being. However, the new fucktard did similar sheningans Zordacz did. It automatically redirected to youtube video without reason.

So, it was then that I fixed all the issues myself using one of the Zordacz's versions.

The script is available here: https://github.com/Humberd/Stuff-unlocked/raw/master/src/index.user.js

The code is open source and can be find here: https://github.com/Humberd/Stuff-unlocked

The features I added:
1. Unlocked autofighter
2. Fixed '48' bug preventing launching the script.
3. General cleanup of the code using unuglyfier

If there is enough interest I could spend the time and make some improvements/bugfixes.

Contribution is welcomed!!! Both code and economical

And remember kids.
